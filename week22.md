# Week
## What did you do last week?
- Got paid!
- Wrote a `changelog(1)`, a tool document the changes made per version on the
  projects.
- Started authoring more issues, so process can be made by other folks.
- Added 5 bots so reviews can be automated.
- Wrote `crossgen(1)` -- an automated release tool.
- Updated random-access-disk, random-access-memory, and hypercore.
- Setup bpb for commit signing (simplified pgp alternative).
- Updated `human-panic` to `v1.1.0`.
- Fixed the logging portion of `clap_flags`.
- Think I've logged the most commits in a single week I've done in the past 2
  years. Got a *lot* of backlog done!

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- Didn't write bitfield RLE.

## What are you planning to work on this week?
I'm really into making `datrs` more maintainable. We're in the final part of the
project right now, and the more we can ensure that maintenance is possible going
forward, the better it'll be.

We still need to get the networking part going, but that's probably worth
tackling after we can make things more maintainable. We already have users of
our projects, so not too worried about that part either right now.

## What's blocking you?
Nothing right now.

## This Week's Video Archives
None recorded.
