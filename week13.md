# Week
Spent a lot of time debugging last week; still working on making Hypercore's
`copy` mechanisms work.

## What did you do last week?
- lots of time spent tracking down bugs in Hypercore
- fixed an out of bounds memory access
- implemented `IntoIterator` for a few APIs.
- fixed the iterator in sparse-bitfield.
- figured out how to use threads.
- implemented the ChaCha crypto algorithm
- wrote like 40 tests across all repos.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- didn't do a stream, pal cancelled I was supposed to pair up with
- no threaded emitter
- no better error handling

## What are you planning to work on this week?
- Continue fixing `.put()` and `.proof()`
- Do another stream
- Continue writing lots and lots of tests

## What's blocking you?
Nothing really; feel like we're on the long tail of the project now.
