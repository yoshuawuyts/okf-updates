# Week
## What did you do last week?
- Gave a talk at peer-to-peer web Berlin.
- Prepared for my talk on Friday.
- Met up with IPFS folks, going to go to their Lisbon event in a couple of
  weeks. Going to be exploring where our projects overlap, and see if we can
  perhaps collaborate where it does.
- Met up with Mafintosh from Dat, datrs seems like it's got a full thumbs up.
  Going to be staying in touch more closely. Probably start a bi-weekly call to
  sync up about Dat core development.
- Went to the Rust hacking evening, which was useful.
- Implemented another hypercore method.
- Tuesday was a holiday.
- Created [github_auth](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/github_auth) to start
  automating some GitHub things later on. Especially change logs / public
  messaging on new releases would be a good one to tackle.
- Moved to Dalek cryptography suite.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- Did some very realistic planning last week; met all goals!

## What are you planning to work on this week?
- Hacking from Verona this week.
- The base methods for hypercore are implemented, so want to focus on writing
  tests + fixing tests. Repeat until things work.
- Fingers crossed we can get something working this week.

## What's blocking you?
- Nothing much!
