# Week
## What did you do last week?
- Did a video stream on HTTP libraries & command line parsing.
- Implemented a "read_to_writer" method for our disk APIs.
- Attended the Rust bindgen meetup to learn more about binding to C.
  - This was extremely helpful; got some concrete next steps I can follow up on.
- Reviewed 2 separate issues from different contributors. They're committed to
  submitting patches for mid-sized functionality this week.
- Built some example network services.
- Updated random-access-disk & random-access-storage
- Read up on network analysis (Vyukov & Gregg)
  - I've been feeling like some of the networking things have been hard to do,
    so figured reading more things might help me get settled in.
- Coordinated an effort to get more example networking applications.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- Didn't make much progress on the networking.

## What are you planning to work on this week?
- Get the compression algorithm up & done.

## What's blocking you?
Nothing.
