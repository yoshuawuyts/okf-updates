# Week 8
## What did you do last week?
- Had the flu for a few days more.
- Got an ear infection for like a day too. That was scary.
- Half-setup a new server.
- Figured out how to reduce friction between Hypercore and Merkle-Tree-Stream
  (took like 1.5 days).
- Updated MTS with the new code.
- Updated Hypercore with the new code.
- Live streamed some Hypercore dev.
- Worked a bunch on Hypercore's verification methods.
- Implemented the Builder pattern to initialize Hypercore. More or less, haha.
- Looked into Troff generation a bit. Man page generation might be a rather
  valuable thing to have.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- Didn't finish the verification methods. Came close though!
- Last remnants of the flu are still here.
- Didn't add compatibility tests - although I did update some existing tests.
- Didn't implement property tests.

## What are you planning to work on this week?
- Monday is off.
- Going to Lisbon on Tuesday evening to hang out with IPFS folks.
- Going to Paris on Friday to attend Rustfest.
- Want to actually finish the verification methods.
- Hang out with Mafintosh & possibly document some of Hypercore's more obscure
  internal bits.

## What's blocking you?
- Going to be spending a lot of time on airplanes in the next few days. That's
  going to be interesting. CDG + TXL twice in four days is some sort of EU
  airport jackpot.
