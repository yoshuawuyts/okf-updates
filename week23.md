# Week
## What did you do last week?
- Kicked off documentation efforts for the Tokio parallel event loop.
- Added github-auth to crossgen.
- Ran a Rust network meeting.
- Met with Florian Gilcher who runs several businesses including a Rust
  consultancy.
- Made crossgen auto-sign keys, which means auto-deployment on all new repos
    should work out of the box.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
None!

## What are you planning to work on this week?
Want to get back into the networking bits of Dat. A lot of the maintenance tools
now work well.

Also need to get started on the preso that happens at the start of next month. I
like to iterate on these things for a few weeks, instead of rushing them out in
a few days.

## What's blocking you?
Nothing!

## This Week's Video Archives
No recordings.
