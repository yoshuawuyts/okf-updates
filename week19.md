# Week
## What did you do last week?
- Worked on securing new funding for datrs.
- Finalized payments (bit late, but all good now!)
- Took on the mantle of web lead for Rust's Web WG
    - Doing this mostly on my own time, but my main goal is to make it so Rust's
      networking story becomes smoother. I've had some problems with this, so
      helping out  will hopefully allow us to all have a better time!
- Hung out with Boats a bunch (Mozilla)
- Finalized man page generation from Arg structs
- Split up the single keypair in Hypercore to be separate public / secret keys.
  - This allows for "read-only mode" / "write mode" to properly work.
- Initialized the Event struct.

## Which goals didn't you meet last week?
- The public / private key pair was necessary for more networking things. So did
  some work here, but did not finalize.

## What are you planning to work on this week?
- Continue working on the networking layer. This is the final (big) step needed
  for Hypercore.

## What's blocking you?
Nothing.

## This Week's Video Archives
No videos this week.
